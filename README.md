Want to leave a meaningful snapshot of a time past by?  Look no further than the Time Capsule!  The Time Capsule is a website where you can create an account and make your own time capsule along with some of your friends and family.  Simply create the capsule, set a date to “bury” the capsule, then leave it on the website so that you can unbury it later!  

You can use the time capsule for the following things:
	- Store meaningful content for family history!
	- Save a multimedia snapshot of your growing company!
	- Keep a record for your town or city!

Time Capsule will allow you to upload any file into a “capsule” and also let you  choose who else gets to upload files into your capsule.  You get to set the time when the capsule will be “buried,” and after this point, the capsule will be closed for uploading new content.  You can then set a time and place for it to be “unburied” and notify your friends and family by e-mail.  Then, you and your loved ones can view all the content of the time capsule and reminisce about the good old days.
